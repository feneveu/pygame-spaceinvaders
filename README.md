Here is my take on Space Invaders! 

I utilized the images from: https://github.com/leerob/space-invaders

From there I used pygame's sprites to bring to life all of the aliens, lasers and the iconic ship.
I built two types of games, one with the classic set up with a mystery alien and another that randomizes
the alien types per row. To win the game you must kill all of the aliens. The mystery alien has a randomized
score value and has a randomized time off and on the screen. Then, all of the aliens(except the mystery alien) 
fires shots back down at the ship. If any alien laser hits the ship, the game ends. If the 
ship hits an alien, the alien dies! 

All in all the description is much less than the actual work that went into it.

I tried to efficiently organize the python files, with each color alien made to be customized,
from there the matrix that holds and moves them is also independent, the ship is independent,
and the bullets/lasers are independent. From there they are all accessed by the main and executed.

I am really happy with the visuals, I had to resize most of the images to fit.
